            <p class="fancy-font">I was reluctant to start watching the series when it came out on Netflix, but once I did, I was hooked within the first few minutes. The premise is as outlandish as it is plausible - if you could imagine that. Well thought out episodes that appear to be unrelated but for the main characters and yet every thing that happens becomes a part of a greater, ever fluid extremely addictive story. Mr. Spader, of course, is the cornerstone of the show. He captivates the audience weaving his way inexorably through the plot line and, incredibly, although his behavior and motives would wear you out because of their singular focus, I never tire of him. Not to mention he’s damn dreamy at 58! If you want to learn quite a lot about the basis for nearly every political conspiracy theory, The Blacklist is a must see. If you want to have a marvelous good time watching some of the best cast of characters negotiate their way each week while riding the coattails of a master criminal with a big heart, don’t miss it.</p>
